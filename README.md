Lightbox Viewer
============
### Description

A simple responsive lightbox viewer built without any libraries. The app is connected with the Flickr API and displays the first 25 results by relevance returned for the entered search term.

### Instructions

1. Open index.html.
2. Type a name or topic into the search box.
3. Click on a thumbnail to see an enlarged version of the image.
4. Click the arrows or press the buttons to go between images.

### Development

Uses [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) to enforce style. Semistandard is [standard](https://github.com/feross/standard), a unified set of JS style rules, but with semicolons.

Run `semistandard` in the `lightbox-viewer` directory to lint.
